I am a final-year undergraduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/about/general_information), majoring in Artificial Intelligence (Honor Class). I am also a member of the [Guozhi Class Program](http://www.qingyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/c/Introductiongzb) and [Zhiyuan Honors Program](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/en/about/overview). In the near future, I will continue my study as a Ph.D. student at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/aboutus/university-intro.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/). I am currently working as a research intern at the [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/aboutus) under the supervision of [Dr. Lei Bai](http://leibai.site/). My research interests lie in large language models (LLM) and multi-agent systems (MAS).
